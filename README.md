# Tip-Calculator

## In-Progress


###### What does it do?

The tip calculator is my first c# project that I have created on my own outside of my coursework. I thought it would be a good way to
apply the C# skills I have learned so far.  It will calculate your tip based on a default percentage you can choose, a custom tip you
can enter, or the tip you should leave if you want to leave even cash.  It is still a work in progress.  I still need to create separate
methods in the future to clean up the main method.  Thanks for looking.
